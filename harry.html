            <h2>   Harry assists Charles' coronation




            </h2>
            <p>Prince Harry was completely engrossed in the proceedings, as he watched from his seat in the third row while the crown was being held above the King's head. He had arrived at the Abbey earlier, dressed in a morning suit and looking relaxed as he chatted with his cousins Princess Beatrice and Princess Eugenie. This was the first time the prince had seen his family since his controversial memoir, Spare, had been published.<p>
              <p>As he walked down the nave of the abbey, he smiled at the guests before taking his place beside Jack Brooksbank, who is the husband of Princess Eugenie, and the Duke of York, Prince Andrew. The prince watched the ceremony intently behind Princess Anne and the Duke of Kent, Queen Elizabeth II's first cousin, who was dressed in Garter robes in the second row.
                <p>In front of him were the Prince and Princess of Wales, their children Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis, the King's brother the new Duke Edinburgh - Prince Edward - and his wife Sophie. Prince Harry had previously sat in the second row, directly behind the King, at Westminster Abbey for the late Queen Elizabeth's funeral last year.

                    Television footage showed Prince Harry watching intently as the archbishop raised St Edward's Crown above his father's head before crowning him. Later, during the homage to the new monarch, the prince joined other royals in saying the words: "God save King Charles. Long live King Charles. May the King love forever."
                <p>Prince Harry reportedly stayed at Frogmore Cottage, the residence he and Meghan were asked to vacate by the King, on the grounds of Windsor Castle on Friday night after landing at London's Heathrow Airport on Friday morning. His wife, the Duchess of Sussex, remained in Los Angeles with their children, where their son Prince Archie was celebrating his fourth birthday.<p>

                    According to a source who spoke to the US outlet Page Six, Prince Harry intended to make "every effort to get back in time for Archie's birthday". Buckingham Palace had previously confirmed that Prince Harry would attend the ceremony alone, and he and his uncle Prince Andrew would have no formal role in the ceremony, as they are not working members of the Royal Family.</p>
